# Your AI Operating System — Start Here

> Delivered by **Otium AI Consultant** — *"Get Your Time Back."*

This folder becomes **your business's AI brain**. Open it in Claude Code and it will know who
you are, remember your decisions, live inside your Obsidian notes, and act in your Google
Workspace.

## How to use this kit

1. **Do the two installs in [`INSTALL-FIRST.md`](INSTALL-FIRST.md)** — Claude Code + Node.js
   (~10 min, the only by-hand part). **Works on Windows and macOS** — the installer auto-detects
   (`setup.ps1` on Windows, `setup.sh` on Mac/Linux). Then open **this folder** in Claude Code.
2. **Type anything — even "hi".** On a fresh OS the **`onboard`** skill takes over and does setup
   *for* you, in order: installs its plugins, connects Google in your
   browser (a couple of quick restarts; just keep going). Then it learns about you — **two ways,
   both optional:** answer a few quick questions (skip any), or just **drop a file** (company
   profile, bio, deck, past emails) into the chat and it'll read it.
3. Ask it: **"What should I focus on this week?"** — that's the moment it clicks.

> Why this order? So the OS is fully connected *before* it starts learning about you — the
> experience is fluent from minute one instead of fragmented. **Heads up:** on your first
> session the OS runs this setup automatically before doing anything else — even if you just
> say "hi" — and it won't skip steps. `SETUP-PLAYBOOK.md` is the
> detailed manual `onboard` follows; open it only if you want the background or get stuck.

## What's already inside

| File / folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `INSTALL-FIRST.md` | The only by-hand part: install Claude Code + Node.js. Start here. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | The operating manual — the rules your AI follows every session. |
| `SETUP-PLAYBOOK.md` | The manual `onboard` follows: plugins, Google connector, Obsidian (native + optional REST API). |
| `aios-intake.md` | The 7 questions `onboard` asks (you can pre-fill it if you like). |
| `connections.md` | A registry of every system your OS can reach. |
| `.claude/skills/` | Fourteen ready skills (see the list below) — setup, capture, knowledge, writing, calendar, and app-building. |
| `wiki/` | Your long-term knowledge base. Empty on purpose — it fills as you feed it. |
| `context/` `references/` `decisions/` `projects/` `tasks/` … | The folders your OS fills as it learns. |

## The skills you get on day one

**Setup & rhythm**
- **`onboard`** — sets up your whole OS: connects your tools first, then learns about you (answer a few questions or drop a file — both optional). Run this first.
- **`audit`** — scores your setup against the Four Cs and hands you the top-3 fixes. Run it weekly to watch the score climb.
- **`level-up`** — a weekly interview that finds one thing worth automating and ships it.
- **`session-handoff`** — a clean end-of-session summary so you can start fresh tomorrow without losing the thread.

**Capture & knowledge**
- **`capture`** — drop a thought, fact, file, or link and it files it in the right place automatically.
- **`wiki`** — your second brain. Feed it sources, then ask it questions and get answers with citations. Grows into a graph you can see in Obsidian.
- **`raw-ingest`** — turn long articles / web clips into clean, sourced knowledge notes.
- **`os-map`** — the librarian: keeps your index current and flags anything stale or misfiled.
- **`grill-me`** — get relentlessly interviewed about any plan or idea; it saves everything to a doc so nothing is lost.

**Writing**
- **`copywriter`** — writes captions, emails, WhatsApp messages, and sales copy in *your* voice, not a model's. No em dashes, no emoji. Works in Indonesian and English.
- **`humanizer`** — run any text through it to strip the tells that make writing read as AI-generated.
- **`house-style`** — your brand in one file: name, contacts, logo, colors, fonts. Set it once and every proposal, invoice, and deck comes out consistent. Ships blank; you fill your own.

**Doing the work**
- **`gcal-manager`** — notices dated events in your chat and puts them on your Google Calendar, cleanly.
- **`frontend-design`** — builds real, distinctive web pages, dashboards, and small apps. Paired with **`references/build-with-claude-code.md`**, a plain-English guide to building and deploying apps here even if you don't code.
