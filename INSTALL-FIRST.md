# 📦 Install First — only 2 things, ~10 minutes

> You install **two** things by hand. After that, open the folder and your AI does the rest
> *inside the chat* — you just click **Allow** when it asks. Powered by Otium AI Consultant.

## 1) Claude Code — the app your AI lives in

**Easiest (no terminal): the Desktop app.**
- Go to **claude.com/download** → download for **Mac** or **Windows** → install like any app.

**Or the one-line installer** (copy → paste → Enter):
- **Mac / Linux** — open the **Terminal** app and paste:
  ```
  curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
  ```
- **Windows** — open **PowerShell** and paste:
  ```
  irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
  ```

Sign in when it opens (use your Claude account — a paid plan is recommended so the Google
connector works in step 3 of onboarding).

## 2) Node.js — a helper the plugins + Obsidian connector need

**Easiest — let your AI do it.** After step 3, when you open the folder, just say
**"install node for me"**. Your AI runs this repo's installer (`setup.sh` on Mac/Linux,
`setup.ps1` on Windows) and sets up Node + npx for you. **No Homebrew.**

**Or do it yourself**, any one of these:
- Run the installer — **Mac/Linux:** `bash setup.sh` · **Windows (PowerShell):** `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1`
- Or download from **nodejs.org** → green **LTS** button → open the file → **Next → Next → Finish**.

That's the technical part done. ✅

## 3) Open your AI OS and say hi

1. Get this folder onto your computer:
   - In **VS Code**: *Clone Git Repository* → paste the repo link, **or**
   - Download the **ZIP** from the repo and unzip it.
2. Open the folder in **Claude Code** (Desktop app: *Open folder*; or `cd` into it and run `claude`).
3. Type anything — even **"hi"**.

Your AI takes over from here: it installs its own skills, helps you connect Google in your browser,
and organizes your vault. When it asks to do something, just click **Allow**.
